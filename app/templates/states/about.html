					<p>If the humidity is too high or low, there is an increased chance of your eggs not hatching.</p>
					<p>To keep the hive dry lean it forward slightly so that rain water can drain out.</p>
					<p>Make sure the hive is ventilated! Moisture can build up in the hive from the nector dehydrating and your bees evaporating water.</p>

					<p>Your bee population will depend on the time of year.</p>
					<p>A hive consists of 20,000 - 30,000 bees in the winter, and over 60,000 - 80,000 bees in the summer.</p>
					<p>The population measured is only the number bees at the enterance of your hive.</p>
					<p>There may be a large number, especially if the bees need to fan out the hive.</p>
					<p>If there are no bees or very little bees, that could cause an alert.</p>
